## FlexLoG

Robotic grasping is a fundamental skill for complex tasks and is essential to intelligent behavior. While most prior methods for general 6-DoF grasping focus on extracting scene-level semantic or geometric information, they often neglect adaptability to diverse downstream applications, such as target-oriented grasping. To address this, we
rethink 6-DoF grasp detection from a grasp-centric perspective and propose FlexLoG, a versatile framework designed to unify scene-level and target-oriented grasping within a single system.
